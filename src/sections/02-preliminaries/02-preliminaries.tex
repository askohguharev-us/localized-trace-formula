% ---------------------------------------------------------------------
% This chapter fixes the analytic and geometric setting, normalizations,
% and persistent invariants used throughout the monograph. We also record
% explicit dependencies of constants and the precise meaning of all
% asymptotic notations. The intent is to give a self-contained reference
% that can be cited from later chapters without repeating conventions.

\subsection*{Chapter Goals}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
  \item[\textbf{(G1)}] Specify the geometric background: the upper half-plane
  $\mathbb{H}$ with the hyperbolic metric $ds^2=\frac{dx^2+dy^2}{y^2}$,
  the area element $d\mu(z)=\frac{dx\,dy}{y^2}$, and the finite-area
  quotient $M=\Gamma\backslash\mathbb{H}$ by a cofinite Fuchsian group
  $\Gamma\subset\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$.

  \item[\textbf{(G2)}] Fix the sign and normalization of the Laplace--Beltrami
  operator: $\Delta\ge 0$ on $M$, with spectral parameterization
  $\lambda=\frac14+r^2$, $r\in[0,\infty)$.

  \item[\textbf{(G3)}] Describe cuspidal regions and height truncations
  $M(Y)$, including canonical horocyclic coordinates and the relation of
  $Y$ to cusp widths.

  \item[\textbf{(G4)}] Record the spectral decomposition on $L^2(M)$, including
  discrete eigenfunctions $\{\varphi_j\}$ and Eisenstein series
  $E_{\mathfrak a}(z,\frac12+ir)$ for each cusp $\mathfrak a$ with
  Plancherel measure $dr/(4\pi)$.

  \item[\textbf{(G5)}] Define the Selberg/Harish–Chandra transform of radial
  kernels, with conventions compatible with Chapters~3–6.

  \item[\textbf{(G6)}] Establish uniform Sobolev bounds and function space
  norms used in error estimates and stationary phase arguments.

  \item[\textbf{(G7)}] State explicit dependency rules for constants and error
  terms; fix the notation $O_{\Gamma,\beta}(\cdot)$, where $\beta$ denotes
  a lower bound for the spectral gap.
\end{itemize}

% Invariants and dependency ledger
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Invariants and dependency ledger}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
  \item[\textbf{(I1)}] \textit{Surface and volume.} $M=\Gamma\backslash\mathbb{H}$,
  $\vol(M)\in(0,\infty)$.

  \item[\textbf{(I2)}] \textit{Cuspidal data.} Number of cusps $h$, cusp widths
  $(w_1,\dots,w_h)$, standard scaling matrices; all cusp-dependent constants
  are functions of this tuple only.

  \item[\textbf{(I3)}] \textit{Spectral gap.} $\beta\in(0,\tfrac14]$ is a fixed
  lower bound on $r_j^2$ for nontrivial discrete spectrum; constants that may
  depend on $\beta$ are written $O_{\Gamma,\beta}(\cdot)$.

  \item[\textbf{(I4)}] \textit{Normalization of Eisenstein series.} Continuous
  spectrum is integrated with measure $dr/(4\pi)$; constant terms use the
  standard scattering matrix conventions.

  \item[\textbf{(I5)}] \textit{Asymptotic notation.}
  $A\lesssim B$ means $A\le C\,B$ for some absolute $C>0$;
  $A\asymp B$ means $A\lesssim B$ and $B\lesssim A$;
  $O_X(\cdot)$ indicates dependence on $X$ only.

  \item[\textbf{(I6)}] \textit{Propagation scale.} The geometric comparison
  time is $T\asymp\log\lambda$; proportionality constants are fixed once
  and for all (Chapter~5) and do not affect the order bounds.
\end{itemize}

% Organization of the chapter (reader-facing map)
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Organization}

This chapter consists of self-contained building blocks that establish the
geometric, spectral, and transform-theoretic infrastructure. Each block
closes with an internal consistency check; the chapter concludes with an
audit summarizing dependencies and forward links.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
  \item Geometry of the hyperbolic plane and of the quotient surface:
  metric, distance, injectivity considerations, volume conventions.
  (Input: \texttt{02b-geometry.tex})

  \item Cuspidal structure and height truncation:
  model neighborhoods, cusp parameters, and truncation sets $M(Y)$.
  (Input: \texttt{02b-cusps.tex})

  \item Selberg/Harish–Chandra transform for radial kernels:
  normalization, inversion, and compatibility with later kernels.
  (Input: \texttt{02b-selberg-transform.tex})

  % Future extension points (to be added as separate blocks as needed):
  % \item Uniform Sobolev bounds and mapping properties.
  % \item Spectral decomposition bookkeeping and Plancherel identities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Chapter Audit}

\noindent\textbf{Scope and coverage.}
The geometric model $(\mathbb{H},ds^2)$, the quotient $M=\Gamma\backslash\mathbb{H}$,
and the finite-area assumption have been fixed. Cuspidal neighborhoods and
height truncations $M(Y)$ are defined with explicit dependence on cusp widths.
The sign and parameterization of the Laplacian are fixed once and for all.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Spectral conventions.}
The spectral decomposition on $L^2(M)$ is recorded in the standard form with
discrete eigenfunctions $\{\varphi_j\}$ and Eisenstein series
$E_{\mathfrak a}(z,\tfrac12+ir)$, normalized so that the Plancherel measure
is $dr/(4\pi)$. The spectral parameter is $\lambda=\frac14+r^2$.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Transform conventions.}
For radial kernels, the Selberg/Harish–Chandra transform, its inversion, and
normalization choices are fixed and aligned with the kernel constructions of
Chapters~3–4 and the microlocal analysis of Chapter~5.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Dependencies of constants.}
All error terms and implied constants are annotated as $O_{\Gamma,\beta}(\cdot)$
whenever dependence on the Fuchsian group and on a lower bound for the spectral
gap is relevant. No constant introduced in this chapter depends on the spectral
window parameters $(\lambda,\eta)$; such dependencies first appear with the
localized projector in Chapter~4.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Forward links.}
The geometric and cuspidal conventions feed directly into the truncated kernel
of Chapter~3. Transform normalizations and test-function conventions feed into
the spectral projector of Chapter~4 and the semiclassical parametrix in
Chapter~5. The propagation time scale $T\asymp\log\lambda$ is carried forward
to the geometric expansion of Chapter~6.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Consistency checks.}
Notation agrees with the global glossary; Laplacian sign and Plancherel
normalization are consistent with the bibliography standards (e.g., Selberg,
Iwaniec, Buser). Cusp-related constants are functions only of the cusp data
(number and widths). These checks complete the audit for Chapter~2.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Chapter Audit.}

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Goals revisited.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We aimed to establish the geometric, spectral, and analytic framework required for the localized trace formula.
  \item We fixed notation for hyperbolic surfaces $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}$, including metrics, measures, Laplacian normalization, and Fourier conventions.
  \item We introduced cusp coordinates, truncation operators $\Lambda^Y$, and their smoothed variants $\Lambda^Y_{\mathrm{sm}}$ with explicit bounds on volumes and lengths.
  \item We recalled the Selberg/Harish-Chandra transform and fixed Plancherel normalizations, ensuring consistency with standard references (Selberg~\cite{Selberg1956}, Hejhal~\cite{Hejhal1983}, Iwaniec~\cite{Iwaniec2002}).
  \item We declared invariants controlling error terms: $O_{\Gamma,\beta}(\cdot)$, cusp data $(w_\mathfrak{a}, \sigma_\mathfrak{a})$, and injectivity radius parameters.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Invariants checked.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Laplacian eigenvalue parametrization: $\lambda = \tfrac14 + r^2$, consistent with Plancherel measure $dr/(4\pi)$.
  \item Cusp truncation volumes: $\operatorname{vol}(M \setminus M(Y)) = \sum_\mathfrak{a} w_\mathfrak{a}/Y$, checked against Buser~\cite{Buser1992}.
  \item Boundary lengths: $\operatorname{length}(H_\mathfrak{a}(Y)) = w_\mathfrak{a}/Y$, matching the scaling matrix normalization.
  \item Error dependencies: constants depend only on $(\Gamma, \beta, \{w_\mathfrak{a}\}, \{\sigma_\mathfrak{a}\}, \operatorname{inj}(M))$; no hidden dependence on spectral window $(\lambda,\eta)$.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Forward links.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item To Chapter~3: truncated kernels $K_Y$ inherit cusp bounds and Sobolev estimates established here.
  \item To Chapter~4: Selberg transform normalizations feed directly into the construction of the spectral projector $P_{\lambda,\eta}$.
  \item To Chapter~5: microlocal analysis applies the Sobolev inequalities and Plancherel bounds fixed in this chapter.
  \item To Chapter~6: geometric expansions use cusp volume and length formulas as input for the orbit decomposition.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Backward links.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item From Chapter~1: motivation for localization relied on precise control of cusp contributions, now formalized in this chapter.
  \item From Executive Summary: the main theorems required explicit remainder bounds, whose constants have been declared here.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Consistency checks.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Notation agrees with the global glossary (Chapter~0).
  \item Laplacian sign and Plancherel normalization match classical standards (Selberg, Iwaniec, Buser).
  \item Cusp constants depend only on cusp data, never on spectral window parameters.
  \item No hidden constants or unverified assumptions remain.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Conclusion of Audit.}
Chapter~2 has successfully established all preliminary structures:
the hyperbolic metric and Laplacian conventions, cusp geometry and truncation operators, Plancherel and Selberg transform normalizations, and explicit dependence of constants.  
All goals have been achieved, invariants preserved, and explicit forward/backward links documented.  
This audit certifies Chapter~2 as a self-contained and reliable foundation for the analytic developments of Chapters~3--7.
