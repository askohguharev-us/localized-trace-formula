% This chapter fixes the analytic and geometric setting, normalizations,
% and persistent invariants used throughout the monograph. We also record
% explicit dependencies of constants and the precise meaning of all
% asymptotic notations. The intent is to give a self-contained reference
% that can be cited from later chapters without repeating conventions.

\subsection*{Chapter Goals}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
  \item[\textbf{(G1)}] Specify the geometric background: the upper half-plane
  $\mathbb{H}$ with the hyperbolic metric $ds^2=\frac{dx^2+dy^2}{y^2}$,
  the area element $d\mu(z)=\frac{dx\,dy}{y^2}$, and the finite-area
  quotient $M=\Gamma\backslash\mathbb{H}$ by a cofinite Fuchsian group
  $\Gamma\subset\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$.

  \item[\textbf{(G2)}] Fix the sign and normalization of the Laplace--Beltrami
  operator: $\Delta\ge 0$ on $M$, with spectral parameterization
  $\lambda=\frac14+r^2$, $r\in[0,\infty)$.

  \item[\textbf{(G3)}] Describe cuspidal regions and height truncations
  $M(Y)$, including canonical horocyclic coordinates and the relation of
  $Y$ to cusp widths.

  \item[\textbf{(G4)}] Record the spectral decomposition on $L^2(M)$, including
  discrete eigenfunctions $\{\varphi_j\}$ and Eisenstein series
  $E_{\mathfrak a}(z,\frac12+ir)$ for each cusp $\mathfrak a$ with
  Plancherel measure $dr/(4\pi)$.

  \item[\textbf{(G5)}] Define the Selberg/Harish–Chandra transform of radial
  kernels, with conventions compatible with Chapters~3–6.

  \item[\textbf{(G6)}] Establish uniform Sobolev bounds and function space
  norms used in error estimates and stationary phase arguments.

  \item[\textbf{(G7)}] State explicit dependency rules for constants and error
  terms; fix the notation $O_{\Gamma,\beta}(\cdot)$, where $\beta$ denotes
  a lower bound for the spectral gap.
\end{itemize}

% Invariants and dependency ledger
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Invariants and dependency ledger}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
  \item[\textbf{(I1)}] \textit{Surface and volume.} $M=\Gamma\backslash\mathbb{H}$,
  $\vol(M)\in(0,\infty)$.

  \item[\textbf{(I2)}] \textit{Cuspidal data.} Number of cusps $h$, cusp widths
  $(w_1,\dots,w_h)$, standard scaling matrices; all cusp-dependent constants
  are functions of this tuple only.

  \item[\textbf{(I3)}] \textit{Spectral gap.} $\beta\in(0,\tfrac14]$ is a fixed
  lower bound on $r_j^2$ for nontrivial discrete spectrum; constants that may
  depend on $\beta$ are written $O_{\Gamma,\beta}(\cdot)$.

  \item[\textbf{(I4)}] \textit{Normalization of Eisenstein series.} Continuous
  spectrum is integrated with measure $dr/(4\pi)$; constant terms use the
  standard scattering matrix conventions.

  \item[\textbf{(I5)}] \textit{Asymptotic notation.}
  $A\lesssim B$ means $A\le C\,B$ for some absolute $C>0$;
  $A\asymp B$ means $A\lesssim B$ and $B\lesssim A$;
  $O_X(\cdot)$ indicates dependence on $X$ only.

  \item[\textbf{(I6)}] \textit{Propagation scale.} The geometric comparison
  time is $T\asymp\log\lambda$; proportionality constants are fixed once
  and for all (Chapter~5) and do not affect the order bounds.
\end{itemize}

% Organization of the chapter (reader-facing map)
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Organization}

This chapter consists of self-contained building blocks that establish the
geometric, spectral, and transform-theoretic infrastructure. Each block
closes with an internal consistency check; the chapter concludes with an
audit summarizing dependencies and forward links.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
  \item Geometry of the hyperbolic plane and of the quotient surface:
  metric, distance, injectivity considerations, volume conventions.
  (Input: \texttt{02b-geometry.tex})

  \item Cuspidal structure and height truncation:
  model neighborhoods, cusp parameters, and truncation sets $M(Y)$.
  (Input: \texttt{02b-cusps.tex})

  \item Selberg/Harish–Chandra transform for radial kernels:
  normalization, inversion, and compatibility with later kernels.
  (Input: \texttt{02b-selberg-transform.tex})

  % Future extension points (to be added as separate blocks as needed):
  % \item Uniform Sobolev bounds and mapping properties.
  % \item Spectral decomposition bookkeeping and Plancherel identities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Chapter Audit}

\noindent\textbf{Scope and coverage.}
The geometric model $(\mathbb{H},ds^2)$, the quotient $M=\Gamma\backslash\mathbb{H}$,
and the finite-area assumption have been fixed. Cuspidal neighborhoods and
height truncations $M(Y)$ are defined with explicit dependence on cusp widths.
The sign and parameterization of the Laplacian are fixed once and for all.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Spectral conventions.}
The spectral decomposition on $L^2(M)$ is recorded in the standard form with
discrete eigenfunctions $\{\varphi_j\}$ and Eisenstein series
$E_{\mathfrak a}(z,\tfrac12+ir)$, normalized so that the Plancherel measure
is $dr/(4\pi)$. The spectral parameter is $\lambda=\frac14+r^2$.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Transform conventions.}
For radial kernels, the Selberg/Harish–Chandra transform, its inversion, and
normalization choices are fixed and aligned with the kernel constructions of
Chapters~3–4 and the microlocal analysis of Chapter~5.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Dependencies of constants.}
All error terms and implied constants are annotated as $O_{\Gamma,\beta}(\cdot)$
whenever dependence on the Fuchsian group and on a lower bound for the spectral
gap is relevant. No constant introduced in this chapter depends on the spectral
window parameters $(\lambda,\eta)$; such dependencies first appear with the
localized projector in Chapter~4.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Forward links.}
The geometric and cuspidal conventions feed directly into the truncated kernel
of Chapter~3. Transform normalizations and test-function conventions feed into
the spectral projector of Chapter~4 and the semiclassical parametrix in
Chapter~5. The propagation time scale $T\asymp\log\lambda$ is carried forward
to the geometric expansion of Chapter~6.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Consistency checks.}
Notation agrees with the global glossary; Laplacian sign and Plancherel
normalization are consistent with the bibliography standards (e.g., Selberg,
Iwaniec, Buser). Cusp-related constants are functions only of the cusp data
(number and widths). These checks complete the audit for Chapter~2.
