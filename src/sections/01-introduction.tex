\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

The Selberg trace formula is one of the most profound identities in modern mathematics, 
forming a bridge between spectral analysis, geometry, and number theory. At its core, it 
provides a way to relate the spectral data of the Laplace--Beltrami operator on a 
hyperbolic surface to the geometry of closed geodesics. This duality has influenced 
decades of research, linking the analytic theory of automorphic forms with the dynamics 
of flows on negatively curved spaces. Yet, despite its central role, the trace formula in 
its classical form is fundamentally global: it averages over the entire spectrum, thereby 
concealing fine structure that is localized in small spectral windows. 

Many problems in modern analysis and number theory require precisely this fine-scale 
resolution: for example, understanding the distribution of eigenvalues in shrinking 
intervals, bounding the growth of automorphic eigenfunctions, and describing local 
correlations of eigenvalues. To address these challenges, we must go beyond the global 
Selberg formula and construct a \emph{localized trace formula} that resolves the discrete 
cuspidal spectrum in short spectral windows, while suppressing the influence of the 
continuous spectrum that arises from the presence of cusps.

The principal objective of this work is to achieve such a localization. We construct 
microlocal projectors $\mathsf{T}_R$ that act as approximate spectral projectors onto 
windows of the form $[R-R^\theta, R+R^\theta]$ for $0<\theta<1$, while simultaneously 
truncating the cuspidal region at height $y \leq R^\beta$, with $\beta \geq 0$. This 
two-parameter framework captures both frequency localization and geometric suppression of 
the continuous spectrum. The outcome is a localized trace formula that combines spectral 
sharpness, microlocal concentration, and explicit control of constants. The error terms 
admit power savings, and all constants depend at most polynomially on the geometric 
invariants of the surface, such as its volume, injectivity radius, and number of cusps.

\paragraph{Main contributions.}
The principal contributions of this paper are the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item We develop the first localized trace formula for finite-area hyperbolic surfaces 
        that isolates the discrete cuspidal spectrum in windows of size $R^\theta$, while 
        controlling contributions from the continuous spectrum via cusp truncation.
  \item We construct microlocal projectors $\mathsf{T}_R$ adapted to hyperbolic geometry 
        and prove that they are approximately idempotent and orthogonal across disjoint 
        windows, with explicit polynomial error terms.
  \item We compute the identity term in terms of an \emph{effective volume} 
        $\vol_{\mathrm{eff}}(X;R,\theta,\beta)$, which stabilizes across the admissible 
        parameter regime and reflects the geometry of the truncated surface.
  \item We evaluate the geometric side, obtaining explicit amplitudes for contributions 
        from short closed geodesics, derived via stationary phase analysis of the kernel.
  \item We establish a \emph{windowed Weyl law} with explicit power-saving error bounds 
        $O(R^{1-\varepsilon(\theta,\beta)})$, where the exponent $\varepsilon(\theta,\beta)$ 
        is computed in terms of the localization parameters.
  \item We demonstrate that all constants depend polynomially on the volume, injectivity 
        radius, and cusp parameters, ensuring uniformity across arithmetic families.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Historical background and prior work}\label{subsec:history}

The Selberg trace formula was introduced in the mid-20th century by Atle Selberg 
\cite{selberg1956}, who demonstrated its power to connect lengths of closed geodesics 
with spectral data of the Laplace operator. Hejhal’s monographs 
\cite{hejhal1976,hejhal1983} expanded the scope of the trace formula to finite-volume, 
noncompact surfaces, establishing the analytic underpinnings of Eisenstein series and 
scattering theory. Müller \cite{mueller1983} clarified the spectral analysis for 
noncompact quotients, while Buser \cite{buser1992} explored geometric inequalities and 
the interplay between spectral and geometric data.

The microlocal viewpoint, where spectral data is studied via the lens of semiclassical 
analysis, emerged in the seminal work of Duistermaat and Guillemin 
\cite{duistermaatguillemin1975} on the wave trace and singularities. Hörmander’s 
monographs on Fourier integral operators \cite{hormander1994III} provided the 
microlocal toolkit that underpins much of the modern approach. Chazarain 
\cite{chazarain1974} and Sogge \cite{sogge1993,sogge2017} expanded this framework to 
treat eigenfunction bounds and spectral multipliers. 

On the number-theoretic side, sup-norm bounds for eigenfunctions, as studied by Iwaniec 
and Sarnak \cite{iwaniec1995}, highlight the delicate balance between spectral analysis 
and arithmetic applications. More recently, Dyatlov and Zworski 
\cite{dyatlov2018,dyatlov2019,zworski2012} have advanced the dynamical perspective, 
studying resonances, decay of correlations, and the fractal uncertainty principle. 
Canzani and Galkowski \cite{canzani2019} refined Weyl laws for manifolds with boundary, 
while Jensen, Sarnak, and collaborators \cite{jensen2021,sarnak2019} investigated local 
spectral statistics with number-theoretic motivations. 

Our contribution builds on this rich history but is distinguished by its explicit 
localization in both frequency and cusp geometry, together with polynomial control of all 
constants—a feature indispensable for applications to analytic number theory.

\subsection{Motivation and challenges}\label{subsec:difficulties}

The localization of a global identity such as the Selberg trace formula presents three 
fundamental challenges:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Continuous spectrum.} The spectral decomposition of the Laplacian on 
        noncompact surfaces involves Eisenstein series, whose contributions are subtle 
        and non-negligible. Truncating the cusps at $y \leq R^\beta$ is necessary to 
        suppress their mass, but this must be done in a manner consistent with microlocal 
        propagation and spectral localization.
  \item \textbf{Effective constants.} Many classical estimates contain implicit or 
        exponentially large constants in terms of geometric parameters, rendering them 
        ineffective for arithmetic families. Achieving explicit polynomial dependence on 
        invariants such as $\vol(X)$, $\inj(X)$, and cusp widths is critical.
  \item \textbf{Microlocalization at scale $R^\theta$.} Constructing an operator that 
        captures only those eigenvalues with $|t_j - R|\leq R^\theta$, while maintaining 
        near-orthogonality between disjoint windows, requires careful microlocal design. 
        Standard Gaussian cutoffs fail here, as their fixed width cannot adapt to shrinking 
        windows and they lack geometric compatibility with cusps.
\end{enumerate}

Overcoming these difficulties forms the technical foundation of our work.

\subsection{Overview of methods and key ideas}\label{subsec:methods}

The core analytic object is the microlocal window operator $\mathsf{T}_R$, built to 
capture spectral contributions in the short interval $[R-R^\theta, R+R^\theta]$. The 
construction proceeds in several stages:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Window function.} We begin with a Schwartz function 
        $\eta \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$, even with $\eta(0)=1$, and define the 
        spectral window function
        \[
          h_R(t) = \eta\!\left(\frac{t-R}{R^\theta}\right).
        \]
        Its Fourier transform is compactly supported at scale $R^\theta$.
  \item \textbf{Radial kernel.} The spherical transform of $h_R$ defines a radial kernel 
        $k_R(\rho)$ on $\mathbb{H}$, with oscillatory behavior concentrated on distances 
        $\rho \lesssim R^\theta$ and primary oscillation $\sim \sin(R\rho)$.
  \item \textbf{Automorphic kernel.} Summing over $\Gamma$, we obtain the automorphic 
        kernel
        \[
          K_R(z,w) = \sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} k_R(d(z,\gamma w)).
        \]
        This kernel reflects both the spectral localization and the underlying geometry.
  \item \textbf{Cusp truncation.} We insert cutoff functions $\chi_Y(y)$, with 
        $Y = R^\beta$, to restrict to $y \leq Y$ in the cusp regions:
        \[
          K_R^Y(z,w) = \chi_Y(y_z)\,K_R(z,w)\,\chi_Y(y_w).
        \]
        This suppresses Eisenstein series, whose $L^2$-mass in truncated cusps decays as 
        $O(R^{-\beta/2+\epsilon})$.
  \item \textbf{Operator definition.} The microlocal projector is then
        \[
          (\mathsf{T}_R f)(z) = \int_X K_R^Y(z,w)\, f(w)\, d\mathrm{vol}(w).
        \]
        By construction, $\mathsf{T}_R$ is self-adjoint and bounded on all Sobolev spaces.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Spectral action.}  
On cusp forms $\varphi_j$ with eigenvalue $1/4+t_j^2$, one finds
\[
  \mathsf{T}_R \varphi_j = \big(h_R(t_j) + O(R^{-A})\big)\,\varphi_j,
\]
for any $A>0$, while the continuous spectrum is annihilated up to negligible error. This 
establishes $\mathsf{T}_R$ as an approximate spectral projector.

\paragraph{Idempotence and orthogonality.}  
We prove that $\mathsf{T}_R^2 - \mathsf{T}_R = O(R^{-\theta})$ in operator norm, 
providing explicit near-idempotence. Moreover, projectors centered at well-separated 
windows are super-polynomially orthogonal:
\[
  \|\mathsf{T}_{R_1}\mathsf{T}_{R_2}\| \ll R^{-M}, \quad \forall M>0,
\]
when $|R_1-R_2|\gg R^\theta$.

\paragraph{Trace computations.}  
The trace of $\mathsf{T}_R$ admits two expansions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Spectral side:} 
    \[
      \Tr(\mathsf{T}_R) = \sum_j h_R(t_j) + O(R^{-\infty}) + O(R^{1-\beta/2+\theta}).
    \]
  \item \emph{Geometric side:} Using Selberg’s trace formula,
    \[
      \Tr(\mathsf{T}_R) = \vol_{\mathrm{eff}}(X;R,\theta,\beta)\,k_R(0) \;+\;
        \sum_{\gamma\neq e}\, \int_{\mathcal{F}} K_R^Y(z,\gamma z)\,d\mathrm{vol}(z).
    \]
    The identity term yields the effective volume, while the sum over $\gamma$ is 
    dominated by finitely many closed geodesics of length $\lesssim R^{-\theta}$.
\end{enumerate}

Balancing the two sides produces the localized trace formula.

\subsection{Statement of main theorem}\label{subsec:mainthm}

\begin{theorem}[Localized trace formula]
Let $X = \Gamma\backslash \mathbb{H}$ be a finite-area hyperbolic surface. Fix parameters 
$0<\theta<1$ and $\beta \geq 0$ with $\varepsilon(\theta,\beta)>0$. As $R\to\infty$, the 
trace of the microlocal projector $\mathsf{T}_R$ satisfies
\[
  \Tr(\mathsf{T}_R) = \vol_{\mathrm{eff}}(X;R,\theta,\beta)\,\frac{C_\eta}{2\pi} R^{1+\theta}
    + \sum_{\substack{\gamma \,\text{primitive}\\ \ell(\gamma)\ll R^{-\theta}}}
      \frac{\ell(\gamma_0)}{2\sinh(\ell(\gamma)/2)}\,R^\theta\,
      \widehat{\eta}(\ell(\gamma)R^\theta)\, e^{iR\ell(\gamma)}
    + O(R^{1-\varepsilon(\theta,\beta)}),
\]
where $C_\eta = \int_\mathbb{R}\eta(u)\,du$ and 
$\vol_{\mathrm{eff}}(X;R,\theta,\beta) = \vol(X) - n R^{-\beta} + O(R^{-2\beta})$, with $n$ 
the number of cusps.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}[Windowed Weyl law]
With notation as above,
\[
  N_{\mathrm{cusp}}(R,\theta) := \#\{j : |t_j-R|\leq R^\theta\}
  = \frac{\vol(X)}{2\pi} R^{1+\theta} + O(R^{1-\varepsilon(\theta,\beta)}),
\]
with constants depending polynomially on $\vol(X)$, $\inj(X)$, and cusp parameters.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Discussion of parameters}\label{subsec:params}

The exponent $\varepsilon(\theta,\beta)$ controlling the error term is given explicitly by
\[
  \varepsilon(\theta,\beta) = \min\!\left\{ \theta,\,1-\theta+\beta,\,\tfrac{1}{2},\,1-2\theta+\beta \right\} - \delta,
\]
for arbitrarily small $\delta>0$.  

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\theta$ governs the window width $R^\theta$. Smaller $\theta$ yields finer 
        resolution but worsens error terms.
  \item $\beta$ controls cusp suppression. Larger $\beta$ improves continuous spectrum 
        suppression but modifies the effective volume.
  \item The constraints yield a nontrivial admissible region. A particularly effective 
        choice is $\theta=\tfrac{1}{2}-\epsilon$, $\beta=\tfrac{1}{2}$.
\end{itemize}

This explicit balance highlights the geometric and analytic interplay in the localized 
trace formula.

\subsection{Comparison with previous approaches}\label{subsec:comparison}

Traditional constructions of spectral projectors in the automorphic setting have relied 
on techniques that are inadequate for the fine-grained analysis targeted here.

\paragraph{Gaussian projectors.}
Projectors based on functions of the form $h(t) = e^{-(t-R)^2}$ have width of order $1$, 
independent of $R$, and thus fail to adapt to shrinking windows $R^\theta$. While such 
kernels can be effective in compact settings, they are poorly suited for noncompact 
surfaces with cusps: exponential tails interact unfavorably with Eisenstein series, and 
there is no built-in mechanism for cusp suppression.

\paragraph{Paley–Wiener methods.}
Compactly supported test functions in frequency yield kernels with poor microlocal 
control. While Paley–Wiener theory ensures analyticity, the resulting error terms 
typically grow faster than polynomially in the relevant geometric parameters, preventing 
uniformity across families.

\paragraph{Global averaging.}
The classical Selberg trace formula, while powerful, averages over the entire spectrum. 
This global character obscures the delicate interplay of short geodesics, cusp truncation, 
and fine spectral statistics.

\paragraph{Our contribution.}
The microlocal projector $\mathsf{T}_R$ simultaneously addresses these issues by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Adapting its frequency width to $R^\theta$, consistent with the uncertainty 
        principle on $\mathbb{H}$.
  \item Integrating cusp truncation into the kernel itself, ensuring suppression of 
        Eisenstein series without ad-hoc modifications.
  \item Preserving microlocal concentration: the kernel is a Fourier integral operator 
        localized to geodesic arcs of length $\lesssim R^\theta$.
  \item Maintaining explicit polynomial dependence of all constants on $\vol(X)$, 
        $\inj(X)$, and cusp parameters.
\end{itemize}

These features make $\mathsf{T}_R$ uniquely effective for localized spectral analysis.

\subsection{Applications and consequences}\label{subsec:applications}

The localized trace formula has wide-ranging applications:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Windowed Weyl laws.}  
        Precise eigenvalue counts in $[R-R^\theta,R+R^\theta]$ with power-saving error 
        terms, uniform over families of congruence covers.
  \item \textbf{Quantum ergodicity in windows.}  
        Restricting the quantum ergodicity theorem to shrinking spectral intervals 
        enables variance bounds of order $O(R^{-\varepsilon})$.
  \item \textbf{Sup-norm estimates.}  
        Localization allows amplification of cusp forms in windows, yielding 
        improvements toward conjectural $L^\infty$ bounds.
  \item \textbf{Spectral statistics.}  
        Orthogonality of projectors across disjoint windows facilitates the analysis of 
        pair correlations and gap distributions, connecting with predictions from random 
        matrix theory.
  \item \textbf{Prime geodesic theorems.}  
        The geometric expansion, localized to short geodesics, provides refined estimates 
        for the distribution of primitive closed geodesics in short intervals.
  \item \textbf{Arithmetic applications.}  
        Fourier coefficient bounds of cusp forms can be derived with explicit polynomial 
        dependence on geometric invariants.
  \item \textbf{Microlocal quantum chaos.}  
        The construction interacts naturally with semiclassical propagation, allowing the 
        study of scarring, wave packets, and dynamics on phase space.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Future directions}\label{subsec:future}

Our analysis suggests several extensions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Higher-rank symmetric spaces.}  
        Extension to $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SO}(n)$ introduces 
        matrix-valued spectral parameters and Arthur’s trace formula.
  \item \textbf{Arithmetic families.}  
        Uniformity across congruence towers and higher-dimensional quotients.
  \item \textbf{Nodal geometry.}  
        Applications to nodal domains and quantum unique ergodicity in short spectral 
        intervals.

  \item \textbf{Analytic number theory.}  
        Refined subconvexity estimates and applications to $L$-functions through localized 
        projectors.
