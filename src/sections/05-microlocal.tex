\section{Microlocal set-up (placeholder)}
\label{sec:microlocal}
This section is a placeholder for the microlocal framework to be added in Block~1.
We record a simple statement to keep references consistent.

\paragraph{Lemma (placeholder).}
\label{lem:time-local}
For a compactly supported smooth test function $\varphi$, the identity
$\int_{\mathbb{R}} \varphi(t)\,dt = \|\varphi\|_{L^1}$ holds. \emph{(Placeholder statement; will be replaced.)}

\paragraph{Remark.}
All symbols and constants here are provisional; no external citations are used in this stub.
