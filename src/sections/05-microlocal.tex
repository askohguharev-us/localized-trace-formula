\section{Microlocal short--time analysis}\label{sec:microlocal}

In this section we derive short--time expansions for the cosine propagator
$U(t)=\cos\!\big(t\sqrt{-\Lap}\big)$ under the height cutoff $\chi_Y$
and prove the bounds that lead to the power saving remainder in the
localized trace. Throughout we keep the notation of \S\ref{sec:kernel}:
$h\in\mathcal{S}(\RR)$ is even with $\supp \widehat{h}\subset[-c_0,c_0]$,
$g_R$ and $\eta_R$ are as there, and $Y=R^\beta$ with $0<\beta<\tfrac12$.

\subsection{Hadamard parametrix and finite propagation.}
Fix $t_0\in(0,c_0)$ smaller than the injectivity radius of the core.
For $|t|<t_0$ the kernel of $U(t)$ on the universal cover $\HH$
admits the standard Hadamard expansion (see, e.g., \cite{zworski2012})
\begin{equation}\label{eq:parametrix}
U(t;z,z')= \sum_{k=0}^{K-1} a_k(z,z')\, \partial_t \big(t^2-d(z,z')^2\big)_{+}^{k-\frac12}
\;+\; R_K(t;z,z'),
\end{equation}
where $a_k$ are smooth amplitudes supported where $d(z,z')<|t|$ and
$R_K$ is $C^\infty$ and $O(|t|^{K-\frac12})$ uniformly on compact sets.
By finite propagation speed, $U(t;z,z')$ vanishes if $d(z,z')>|t|$.

On $X=\Gamma\backslash\HH$ we sum~\eqref{eq:parametrix} over $\Gamma$.
For $|t|\le c_0/R$ only the diagonal and the terms corresponding to
closed geodesics of length $\le c_0$ contribute to the trace; this is
the geometric restriction that ultimately produces the sum over short
closed geodesics in Proposition~\ref{prop:geom}.

\subsection{Identity contribution and effective volume.}
Using Lemma~\ref{lem:time-local}, write
\[
\TR=\Tr\!\big(\chi_Y h_R(\sqrt{-\Lap}) \chi_Y\big)
= \int_{\RR}\eta_R(t)\, g_R(t)\, \Tr\!\big(\chi_Y U(t)\chi_Y\big)\,dt
+ O(R^{-N}).
\]
Inserting the diagonal part of~\eqref{eq:parametrix} and integrating in $t$
against $\eta_R(t)g_R(t)$ we recover the identity term of
Proposition~\ref{prop:identity} with the effective volume
$\vol_{\mathrm{eff}}(Y)=\int_X \chi_Y^2\,d\mu$. The calculation is identical
to the standard proof of the Weyl law, except that the time window
$|t|\lesssim R^{-1}$ yields a contribution of size $R^{1+\theta}$ from the
one--dimensional stationary phase at the center $R$ of the frequency window.

\subsection{Off--diagonal decay outside periodic directions.}
We now bound the non--diagonal part of the trace outside closed geodesics.
Let $\Theta\subset T^*X$ be a small conic neighborhood of the collection of
periodic covectors with period $\le c_0$. Choose a zeroth--order
pseudodifferential cutoff $A\in\Psi^0(X)$ that equals~$1$ outside~$\Theta$.
Using Egorov's theorem for $|t|\le c_0/R$ and the fact that the support of
$\eta_R$ restricts to these times, we obtain
\[
\Tr\!\big(\chi_Y U(t)\chi_Y\big)
= \Tr\!\big(\chi_Y A\,U(t)\,A\chi_Y\big) \;+\; \Tr\!\big(\chi_Y (I-A)\,U(t)\,(I-A)\chi_Y\big)
\;+\; O(R^{-\infty}).
\]
The first trace is negligible after the $t$--integration by stationary phase:
away from periodic directions, the phase has no stationary points, hence for
every $N$,
\[
\int \eta_R(t)\, g_R(t)\, \Tr\!\big(\chi_Y A\,U(t)\,A\chi_Y\big)\,dt
= O_N(R^{-N}).
\]
The second trace is supported microlocally near periodic covectors; its
contribution is evaluated by the Selberg--type parametrix and sums to the
geometric term of Proposition~\ref{prop:geom} (short closed geodesics only).

\subsection{Commutators with the height cutoff.}
Finally we control the error produced by moving $\chi_Y$ through the
windowed projector. Lemma~\ref{lem:comm} shows that
\[
\big\|[\Pi_{R,\theta},\chi_Y]\big\|_{L^2\to L^2}
\lesssim R^{-1+\theta} Y^{-1} \,\|\nabla\chi\|_\infty
\asymp R^{-1+\theta-\beta}.
\]
Coupling this with the effective rank estimate of
Lemma~\ref{lem:rank}, $\Tr(\chi_Y \Pi_{R,\theta}\chi_Y)\asymp
\vol_{\mathrm{eff}}(Y)\,R^{1+\theta}$, and using Cauchy--Schwarz yields
a commutator contribution bounded by $O\!\big(R^{1-2\theta+\beta}\big)$.

\subsection{Power saving remainder.}
Collecting the three sources of error (nonstationary off--diagonal,
single integration by parts in~$r$ within the identity piece,
and the commutator error) we obtain the exponent
\[
\varepsilon(\theta,\beta)
=\min\Big\{\theta,\; \tfrac12,\; 1-\theta+\beta,\; 1-2\theta+\beta\Big\}
-\delta,\quad \forall\,\delta>0,
\]
which is positive on the admissible region
$0<\beta<\tfrac12$, $0<\theta<\tfrac{1+\beta}{2}$. This proves the
power saving reported after Proposition~\ref{prop:geom} and prepares
the ground for the final assembly in \S\ref{sec:geometric}.
