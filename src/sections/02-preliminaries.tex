\section{Notation and preliminaries}\label{sec:prelim}
Let $X=\Gamma\backslash\HH$ be a finite-area hyperbolic surface.
We record geometric constants $C_{\mathrm{geo}}(X)$, cusp neighborhoods, 
the height cutoff $\chi_Y$, and the spectral window centered at $R$ with width $R^\theta$.
(Details to be expanded in Block~1.)
