\section{Geometric contribution: primitive orbits and uniform bounds}\label{sec:geometric}
Let $\widehat{h}$ be supported in $[-c_0,c_0]$ and define $\widehat{h}_R(s):=R^\theta e^{iRs}\widehat{h}(R^\theta s)$. In the Selberg trace formula the closed-orbit term is localized to short lengths by $\supp \widehat{h}\subset[-c_0,c_0]$. We write the geometric sum as
\[
\mathcal{G}_R(\chi_Y,h)
:= \sum_{\substack{\gamma\ \mathrm{primitive\ closed}\\ \ell(\gamma)\le c_0}}
\frac{\ell(\gamma)}{2\sinh(\ell(\gamma)/2)}\,
W_Y(\gamma)\,\widehat{h}_R(\ell(\gamma)),
\]
where $W_Y(\gamma)$ is the microlocal weight induced by $\chi_Y$ (restriction of $\chi_Y^2$ along a lift of $\gamma$). Since $0\le \chi\le 1$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:weightbound}
|W_Y(\gamma)|\le \|\chi\|_{L^\infty}^2\le 1 .
\end{equation}

\begin{proposition}[Uniform geometric bound]\label{prop:geom}
With the above notation one has
\[
\mathcal{G}_R(\chi_Y,h)=O(1)
\]
as $R\to\infty$, with the implicit constant depending polynomially on $C_{\mathrm{geo}}(X)$ and on $\|\chi\|_{C^1}$, and linearly on $\|\widehat{h}\|_{L^1}$ and $c_0$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Sketch]
By \eqref{eq:weightbound} it suffices to control
\[
\sum_{\substack{\gamma\ \mathrm{primitive}\\ \ell(\gamma)\le c_0}}
\frac{\ell(\gamma)}{2\sinh(\ell(\gamma)/2)}\,|\widehat{h}_R(\ell(\gamma))|.
\]
For fixed $c_0$, the number of primitive closed geodesics with $\ell(\gamma)\le c_0$ is finite and controlled in terms of $C_{\mathrm{geo}}(X)$ (short-geodesic counting; see e.g.\ \cite{buser1992}). The factor $\frac{\ell(\gamma)}{2\sinh(\ell(\gamma)/2)}$ is uniformly bounded. Finally $|\widehat{h}_R(\ell)|\le R^\theta \|\widehat{h}\|_{L^\infty}$ on its support but the support has measure $O(R^{-\theta})$, so the total size is $O(1)$ after a Riemann-sum comparison.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Boundary case $\beta=0$]
When the height cutoff is removed ($\beta=0$), the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:main} uses the commutator bound with $Y^{-1}$ absent, yielding the compact-type error $O(R^{1-\theta})$; see also Remark in \S\ref{sec:microlocal}.
\end{remark}
