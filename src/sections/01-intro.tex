\section{Introduction}

% Context/motivation
The classical Selberg trace formula relates the Laplace spectrum on a finite-area hyperbolic surface to lengths of closed geodesics.  
This preprint initiates a \emph{localized} (windowed/microlocal) variant adapted to spectral windows and test functions supported near prescribed regions in phase space.

% Main idea (one–two sentences, rough)
Our approach uses a phase–space cut-off $\chi_Y$ and a smoothing kernel $h\in\mathcal S(\RR)$ to define a localized trace
\[
  \TR := \sum_j h_R(r_j)\,\langle \chi_Y \psi_j,\psi_j\rangle,
\]
and proves an expansion uniform in the window parameters.

% Contributions (bullets -> ты отредактируешь)
\paragraph{Contributions.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Formulation of a microlocally localized trace identity for finite-area hyperbolic surfaces;
  \item Admissible range for $(\theta,\beta)$ and explicit error terms;
  \item Windowed Weyl law consequences.
\end{itemize}

% Roadmap (структура работы)
\paragraph{Organization.}
Section~\ref{sec:prelim} fixes notation and recalls spectral facts.
The main localized identity and its admissible range are stated in Section~\ref{sec:main}.
Proofs and refinements are deferred to subsequent blocks.
