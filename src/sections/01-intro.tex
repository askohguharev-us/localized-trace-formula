\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

The Selberg trace formula is a cornerstone of spectral geometry and automorphic forms. 
It provides a deep identity linking the length spectrum of closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces 
to the eigenvalue spectrum of the Laplace--Beltrami operator. 
However, the classical formula is global in nature: it averages over the entire spectrum and 
does not directly yield information about short spectral windows. 
This global character limits its effectiveness in questions requiring fine resolution, 
such as eigenvalue statistics in short intervals or the study of sup-norms of automorphic forms. 

The purpose of this work is to develop a \emph{localized trace formula} 
that isolates the discrete cuspidal spectrum of a finite-area hyperbolic surface $X=\Gamma\backslash \HH$ 
inside short spectral windows $[R-R^\theta, R+R^\theta]$ with $0<\theta<1$, 
while simultaneously controlling contributions from the continuous spectrum. 
Our approach combines microlocal analysis with a carefully constructed cutoff at cusp height, 
thus avoiding spurious terms and achieving effective error bounds.

\subsection{Historical context}\label{subsec:history}

The origin of trace formulas lies in Selberg's pioneering work \cite{selberg1956}, 
further developed by Hejhal \cite{hejhal1976, hejhal1983} and Müller \cite{mueller1983}. 
Their results provided the analytic foundation for connecting spectra to geometry. 
Subsequent developments include the influential work of Iwaniec and Sarnak \cite{iwaniec1995}, 
which established sup-norm estimates for eigenfunctions, 
and Buser's geometric analysis of isoperimetric inequalities \cite{buser1992}. 
Recent semiclassical and microlocal perspectives, pioneered by Zworski and collaborators 
\cite{zworski2012, dyatlovzworski2019}, have enriched the field with tools to study local spectral statistics. 

For noncompact arithmetic surfaces, Booker and Strömbergsson \cite{booker2006} 
introduced methods for handling continuous spectrum contributions, 
and Chazarain \cite{chazarain1974} laid early foundations for microlocal techniques. 
These references form the intellectual backbone of the present work.

\subsection{Main difficulties}\label{subsec:difficulties}

The classical Selberg formula faces three fundamental challenges in the localized regime:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Continuous spectrum:} Noncompact surfaces introduce Eisenstein series, 
  whose contributions are delicate to control in short spectral windows.
  \item \textbf{Effective constants:} Previous approaches often yielded implicit or exponential constants. 
  For applications in number theory and quantum chaos, polynomial dependence on geometric data is essential.
  \item \textbf{Microlocalization:} Isolating spectral parameters in windows of size $R^\theta$ 
  requires refined projectors that preserve orthogonality and avoid smearing across scales.
\end{enumerate}

Addressing these three challenges is central to the present work. 

\subsection{Statement of results}\label{subsec:results}

Our main theorem is a microlocalized trace formula that effectively localizes the cuspidal spectrum.

\begin{theorem}[Localized trace formula]\label{thm:main}
Let $X=\Gamma\backslash \HH$ be a finite-area hyperbolic surface. 
For $R\to\infty$ and window size $R^\theta$ with $0<\theta<1$, one has
\[
\Tr\, \TR = \vol_{\mathrm{eff}}(X;Y,R,\theta) 
   \;+\; \sum_{\substack{\gamma \in \Gamma \\ \text{closed geodesics}}} 
   \mathcal{A}_\gamma(R,\theta) 
   \;+\; O\!\left(R^{1-\varepsilon(\theta,\beta)}\right),
\]
where $\vol_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is the \emph{effective volume} defined by a cusp cutoff $y\le Y=R^\beta$, 
the second sum runs over closed geodesics $\gamma$ of length $\ell(\gamma)$ with amplitude
\[
\mathcal{A}_\gamma(R,\theta) \;=\; 
\frac{\ell(\gamma_0)}{2\sinh(\ell(\gamma)/2)} \, 
\widehat{f}(\ell(\gamma)) \, R^\theta,
\]
and the error exponent $\varepsilon(\theta,\beta)>0$ depends explicitly on the localization parameters. 
The detailed computation of $\vol_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is given in \cref{app:effvol}.
\end{theorem}

This formula isolates the discrete cuspidal spectrum in short intervals, 
achieves power savings in the remainder, 
and provides explicit polynomial control of constants in terms of the geometry of $X$. 

\subsection{Novel contributions}\label{subsec:novelty}

The contributions of this paper are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Localized spectral windows:} First trace formula isolating the discrete spectrum 
  inside $[R-R^\theta,R+R^\theta]$ with effective error terms.
  \item \textbf{Microlocal projectors:} Construction of projectors adapted to short windows, 
  preserving orthogonality and eliminating continuous-spectrum artifacts.
  \item \textbf{Effective constants:} All constants depend polynomially on geometric invariants 
  (injectivity radius, volume, cusp parameters).
  \item \textbf{Power-saving remainder:} Error term $O(R^{1-\varepsilon})$ 
  with explicit dependence on localization parameters.
  \item \textbf{Applications:} Provides tools for sup-norm estimates, eigenvalue statistics, 
  and number-theoretic conjectures (e.g., prime geodesic theorems in short intervals).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Applications and outlook}\label{subsec:applications}

The localized trace formula has far-reaching implications:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Quantum unique ergodicity in frequency windows:} 
  Understanding equidistribution of eigenfunctions restricted to $[R-R^\theta,R+R^\theta]$.
  \item \emph{Sup-norm bounds:} Explicit uniform $L^\infty$ estimates for automorphic forms 
  using localized spectral projectors.
  \item \emph{Number theory:} New perspectives on the prime geodesic theorem in short intervals 
  and its relation to spectral gaps.
  \item \emph{Random wave conjecture:} Testing eigenvalue statistics against predictions of quantum chaos.
  \item \emph{Spectral geometry:} Fine structure of eigenvalue distribution for arithmetic surfaces.
\end{itemize}
