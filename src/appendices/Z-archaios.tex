\section{Public ARCHAIOS metrics (ancillary)}\label{app:archaios}
We include a public, non-proprietary assessment of this block produced by ARCHAIOS:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ancillary/archaios_public_report.json}
\item \texttt{ancillary/archaios_public_report.csv}
\end{itemize}
The fields are:
\[
\mathrm{KPD},\ \mathrm{KGD},\ \mathrm{KSD},\ \mathrm{KSR},\ \mathrm{KFZ},\ \mathrm{KKA},\ \text{composite},\ \text{confidence}.
\]
No recommendations are disclosed in the public flavor; see the ancillary README for definitions.
