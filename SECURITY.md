# Security & Publication Policy

- This repository publishes **results and public metrics only**.
- **No internal methodology**, algorithms, or recommendations are exposed here.
- CI guards block accidental publication of sensitive content (denylist + allowlist).
- If you suspect an exposure, open a **Security advisory** (private) or email the maintainer.
