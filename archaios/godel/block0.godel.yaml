      X = Γ\H is a finite-area hyperbolic surface with m cusps.
      We fix an orthonormal cuspidal basis {ψ_j} of eigenfunctions
      with eigenvalues λ_j = 1/4 + r_j^2.

    text: >
      Choose Y large. Let χ_Y be a smooth cutoff supported on the
      Y-thick part and equal to 1 on the Y/2-thick part.

    text: >
      h ∈ 𝒮(ℝ) is even; χ ∈ C_c^∞(ℝ) is even. Set h_R(t) = h(t/R).

  - id: B0-TR
    name: Localized-trace-definition
    text: >
      Define TR := Σ_j h_R(r_j) ||χ_Y ψ_j||^2_{L^2}. This is the
      quantity estimated and compared to the geometric side
      in later blocks.

assumptions:
  - A1: Spectral expansion holds; Maass cusp forms form an ONB.
  - A2: Standard growth bounds on eigenfunctions on thick parts.
